# 1.BASIC INTRODUCTION
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. Some calculators perform all of these functions by repeated processes of addition.
Caluclators are used for those calculations which are beyond humanâ€™s ability. Hence building a calculator is necessary.

## 2.1.1 Basic Calculators
The basic, portable calculators are used in almost every office and home. They are perfect for doing general-purpose calculations and basic math tasks, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and logarithm.
## 2.1.2 Scientific Calculators 
Scientific calculators are specially designed to solve problems in science, engineering, mathematics. Some of these calculators include statistical and trigonometric calculations, and some even have the ability to perform computer algebra. Expensive
